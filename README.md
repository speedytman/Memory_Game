# Memory_Game

**App Description**
>  There are a total of twelve (12) cards, six (6) sets in total that need be matched. While the player is matching the cards, 
music is playing and they are timed for how long it takes them to match the cards. On the game screen, there are buttons to pause and
start the timer as well as a new game button. On the home page, we created a new game, rate us, and help buttons for the user.

**How It Was Implemented**
> We decided to make a memory card game using Java and Kotlin in Android Studio. To make the card faces we used a GridLayout and 
imageButtons. We also imageButtons on the game page for pausing the timer, restarting the timer, and starting a new game; as well 
as for the home page for starting a new game, rating the game, and a help page.

**Issues and Further Work**
> One issue we have been facing is saving the game's state when switching from portrait to landscape orientation, as both layouts 
have different row and column counts. Another issue we ran into was not knowing where to put our reviews since we were not able
to get our app on the Google Play Store. In the future, we would like to implement a high score board, incorporate the use of 
fragments to make the app run more smoothly, and add a music on/button.
